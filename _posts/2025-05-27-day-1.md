what_i_learned: |
  It was the first day of the program, and I got acquainted with fellow participants and the program coordinators. I also had a chance to talk to my team members more closely in a breakout room. We took a Python placement test, and I was placed in the Python 101 class.

  It was great learning about Git and GitHub. I thought it would be complicated, but it was actually straightforward. I learned how to create a repo and make commits, along with many new Git concepts. We also designed a blog GitHub page to record our daily activities throughout the program. For fun, we played social networking bingo and a Jeopardy game to test our Git knowledge.

  Overall, the first day was a success. I got acclimated to the program and my fellow participants, and I enjoyed the engaging activities. Learning about Git and GitHub exceeded my expectations, and I'm excited about the skills I'll develop during this internship. I look forward to what the coming days have in store for me.
