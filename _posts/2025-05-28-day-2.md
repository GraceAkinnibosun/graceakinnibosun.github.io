what_i_learned: |
  Today, I met my mentor, Sudip Sharma, a PhD student in computer science. He explained the project to us. I also received my Python placement test results, which indicated I tested at the beginner level, so I joined the Python 101 class accordingly. We spent the day playing games such as Hedbanz and explored beginner-level topics in Python. We learned about different functions, their meanings, and uses. We also learned what Python is and the 3 data types. Also, we learned that strings are collections of numbers and characters. We continued to work on the GitHub blog page today as well.

  Overall, it was a great class. I found it very informative and gained a solid understanding of the basics of Python. I learned about functions, data types, and the concept of strings as collections of numbers and characters. I picked up several important programming concepts, which will help me as I continue my learning journey.
