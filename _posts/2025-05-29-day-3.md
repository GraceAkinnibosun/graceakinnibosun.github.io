what_i_learned: |
  We started the day by attending a Computer Vision workshop, where we learned to build a simple object detection model using the Teachable Machine tool by Google. We also wrote code for another object detection model that works with both images and videos using the YOLO library.

  Next, we built on the information we learned yesterday. We emphasized the importance of variables and different codes using Replit. We performed algorithms through type casting and print functions. Variables are names for groups, integers are whole numbers, and floats are numbers with decimal points.

  We also played a mystery escape room game, Enchambered, before our lunch break, which was very fun!

reflection: |
  Today was productive. I learned about variables, algorithms, and their importance in Python, including data types. The Computer Vision workshop was engaging, and I enjoyed working with Teachable Machine and the YOLO library. I would like to thank Andrew, the host of the workshop, for showing us a good bit about computer vision. I look forward to tomorrow’s class!
