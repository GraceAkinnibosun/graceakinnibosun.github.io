reflection: |
  TBD Overall today class was really great, I learned so much, the Kahoot was very informative and engaging. I loved the last activity we ddi as a group where we determined if the picture is AI generated or a real image.In my group Python 101 we started to discuss advanced Python topics, and I feel like I am getting the hang if it, although it will take a bit more practice.
