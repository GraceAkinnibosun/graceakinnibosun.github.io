what_i_learned: |
  I learned today the introduction to detect abnormal abnormalities, to predict miocardial infraction. I achived learning to know my more about my classmates and the face of who they are. I also leanred the background of CEALMS. I also learned about how machine learning can play a vital role on ECG. And why it could be resourceful and threatning to the future of healthcare.I especially enjoyed the group discussion we completed in the beginning of the day for us to decipher agaiinst independent and dependent variables cooking cookies.

  This helped me better understand how attention levels fluctuate, especially when switching between tasks. I also learned how to calculate moving averages to reduce noise in the signal while preserving response time.

blockers: |
  The biggest challenge was reading the Electrocardiography graphs, and understanidn some of the terminology they were using in class today. 

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed familiarizing myself with my project. It was nice to see the face of who my mento and graduate mentor will be. Some concepts such as AI terminology was a bit hard to undertsnad, but overall today was a good effecient day. The only thing I would change or add is the more clearer instrcutions. I also, would like them to elbaborate as mentors on whats expected from us by the end of the week.I will say I was lost a good portion of the time so making sure everyone understands the directions clearly should also be implemmented.
