what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on how to change images in googlecoloab. As a group we also worked on Udemy. We also downloaded ECG files per our graduate mentor Sudip request.We also learned how to denoise photos in googlecolab. This helped me better understand how attention levels fluctuate, especially when switching between tasks. I also learned how to calculate moving averages to reduce noise in the signal while preserving response time.

blockers: |
 Todays blocker was downloading the files 

reflection: |
   TBD Overall today class was really great, I learned so much. We started too really dive deep into the project. And it was nice learning how to utilize googlecolab to help with ecg data models. And, how to download pictures in Googlecolab.
