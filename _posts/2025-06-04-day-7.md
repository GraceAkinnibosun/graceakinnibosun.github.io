what_i_learned: |
 Today we explored different research ECG data other researchers have done.Reviewing and evaluating previous studies using ECG (electrocardiogram) data gathered by other researchers was the main goal of today's session.  This was an excellent chance to learn about the range of research that has already been done in this area.  We looked at a range of strategies and techniques, such as how various groups have gathered, processed, and deciphered ECG data for diverse medical and diagnostic applications.

    Overall today class was really great, Our comprehension of ECG data has increased as a result of this work, which has also enabled us to identify any potential gaps or areas for further study.  It offered a strong basis for organizing our own studies, guaranteeing that we advance the area while adding to the body of information already in existence.We discovered common methods, including signal filtering, feature extraction, and the use of machine learning for arrhythmia detection, by looking at earlier studies.  It also provided us with information about the kinds of problems that researchers encountered, such as handling noise in ECG recordings or guaranteeing data correctness, and how they resolved them.
