what_i_learned: |
 Today we started off the day working on finalizing denosing the program on Google collab. Next we followed up with working as a group on the first week on presenting our presentation. We all collectively gathered information regarding all we went through this week and last week. And what we plan on accomplishing in the upcmomg week. After, we recorded our group presentation as a group and discussed the importance of the work we are doing in are project. 
  
blockers: |
  The biggest challenge was keeping my team members on track of the task. Sometimes I found them being distracted. But with extra encouragement we were able to focus and get back on track.

reflection: |
 Overall today was fairly chill, not too tedious. I did run into some challenges or blockers as you must say within my group.   I enjoyed this week, my team is very helpful. And whenever I need help I am able to ask them for help. It is nice knowing that I have relaible group memebers. I like the fact that we are on campus and we can explore within other groups to see what they are working on.
