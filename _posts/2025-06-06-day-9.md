what_i_learned: |
 Today we started off the day working on finalizing denosing the program on Google collab. Next we followed up with working as a group for the first presentation. We all collectively gathered information regarding what we went through this week, and last week. And what we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week. After, we recorded our group presentation and discussed the importance of the work we are doing in our project. 
  
blockers: |
  The biggest challenge was keeping my team members on track of the task. Sometimes I found them being distracted. But with extra encouragement we were able to focus and get back on track.

reflection: |
 Overall today was fairly chill, not too tedious. I did run into some challenges or blockers as you must say within my group.   I enjoyed this week, my team were very helpful. And whenever I need help I am able to ask them for help. It is nice knowing that I have relaible group memebers. I like the fact that we are on campus, and we can explore within other groups to see what they are working on.
