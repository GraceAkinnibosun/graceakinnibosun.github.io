 Today we started off the day getting acquainted to our research project. Professor Timothy stop by to explain the expectations and timeline has for us concerning the project. He gave each one of my group members assigned task to have completed by next monday. For me I am in charge of the technical writing since that is my strog suite due to my psychology and lab background. He also assigned me to go over peer revied research regarding Cardiovascular disease.

 Overall today was a better monday than most. It was nice having a clear overview of whats expected from us moving forward. I will start working on my technical research description for our project today. I will have to look over the slides my graduate mentor Sudip shared with the group to discern which research on Cardiovascular disease is relevant to my review. Their is still much I need to learn regarding Python but I do feel as though I am in a good space.
