what_i_learned: |
   Today we changed our dataset to a dataset that has numerical data. This was done to prevent presenting the data set inaccurately. Our dataset was modified today to include numerical data.  To avoid misrepresenting the dataset and to maintain the objectivity and quantifiability of our study, this was done.  Working with numerical data enables us to produce visualizations like scatter plots and histograms, apply statistical techniques more successfully, and make more understandable inferences based on quantifiable variables.

reflection: |
  Overall, today was boring. I read over 5 articles regarding Cardiovascular disease to better support my analysis. Additionally, adding numerical data to our work this modification lessens the possibility of misunderstandings that can arise when dealing with qualitative or categorical data.  All things considered, this choice bolsters the validity of our results and encourages a more exacting method of data analysis.
