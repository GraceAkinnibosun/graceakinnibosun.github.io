what_i_learned: |
  Today I researched ECG papers. I compared the research I gathered from the diffrent articles I looked on GoogleScholar, with the data that my graduate mentor Supdip shared with the class. I also watched ECG videos on Youtube to see how can I interpret the ECG dataset better. As a class we collectively worked on our research paper figuring out diffrent algorthms thaat can better pair with the ECG research we are conducting.

  Interpreting ECG dataset

reflection: |
  Today class was slow. I did alot of reading and researching to find which research better fit the technical anaylsis ive been asked to write by Professor Oladunni. It took me a while to grasp the concepts of interpreting the ECG data. I went through alot of vidoes and papers, I do think now my understading of ECG graphs is far more better now compared to when I first started. I look forward to whats in store for us tommorrow.
