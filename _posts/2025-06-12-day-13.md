what_i_learned: |
  Today we did a icebreaker with the group. We played Jenga, and Taboo as a group 1 and 2. We also worked on Overleaf, and posting our blogs. In addition to this we worked on our research paper and gathering data. My mentor also brough us Nepali food to try called Aloo chop. We also talked about different field trips we want to go on this weekend.

reflection: |
  Today class was slow.  It wasnt bad I liked it. The games were very engaging and it made me happy to play with my peers. I liked the game of Taboo and it was funny. But Overleaf was easy to use suprisingly. Today went by slower than the rest. But, I am looking forward to tommorrow.
