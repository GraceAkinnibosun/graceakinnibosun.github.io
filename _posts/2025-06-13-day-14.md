what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on graphing the data for the research project. I also did the driving simulation experiment to see if adding drones on the road can better imrpove driving techniques. In additon to this I completed the Methodology section for our research project. I explained definitions such as Bnadwith, denoicing, and preprocessing. I also explained the importance of the work we are doing and how it will benefit users in the near future.

reflection: |
Class was not bad. It went by pretty quickly, although I did sit for a long while for the driving simulation. The driving simulation I was expecting it to be quick in and out but the waiting process took longer than I anticipated but it was not bad. It was fairly easy for the most part. I am however happy to have gotten somewhere on the research project now I just have to upload it into Overleaf.
