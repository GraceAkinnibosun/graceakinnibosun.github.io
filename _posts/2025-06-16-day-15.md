what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused heavily on the writing the literature review for our final project. Professor Timothy, came by and reviewed the assignments he gave us last week to complete which was the methodology for me. He gave constructive feedback on each of my team works assignment, each one of us had diffrent task. He then assigned the work we will be completing for this week. Lastly, I replied to the week 2 presentations for other groups. 

blockers: |
  Constructing the outline for the literature review according to the professor standards.

reflection: |
  Overall todays class went by smoothly. I am happy because I finally have an understading of whats going on. I feel like I am actaully making progress. I did appreciate Proffessor Tim allowing me to work on the writing aspect of the project as he knows I am not skilled in the technical aspect of the research due to my limited computer science background. I look forward to whats in store for tomorrow.
