what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on the Literature review. Per professor Timothy, advice I fixed what needed to be fixed. I also read 20 diffrent articles and compared it to our research to see how our project could differ for the work thst has already been completed by others. Next, I created a 20 column chart and list the methods the used for ther research, and how my team could improve it.Tommorow I will review the graphs and debrief the new highschool teacher that will join us.

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
 Overall today was tiring. Each of the members in our team got to a good point in our project, but theirs still alot of work to be done. Tommorrow I will shift my focus to the techincal aspects of the research we are completing, and start working on comparing graphs and other data involving ECG CVD that researchers have already completed.Hopefully tommorrow wont be to stressful but I am excited to meet our new group member.
