what_i_learned: |
  Today we were introduced to our high school teacher mentor thatll be joining us for the duration of the program. We as a group have to give a 30 second memo on what our project is about and what it entails.We then presented it to the new high school teachers to guess what our project topic is. That excerise stood as an  excerise to test our mentors. We then debreif the high school teacher mentor on what we have been doing so far and were we are at now in our project. 

blockers: |
  Hostile group members.

reflection: |
  I rather have done this on zoom but we had to go in person to do it. Our high school teacher mentor seem cool, we did a few ice breakers with her, her name is Ms Heather. I am interested to see what she will bring to the table during her 6 weeks this summer. My group members were acting pretty rude and hostile, so it put me in a negative state of mind. I am looking forward to our one day vacation tommorrow to cool down. Good thing is that we are progressing to week 5 thats a major plus in my book.
