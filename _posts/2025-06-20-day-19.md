  Analyzing the numerical data from the datasets.

reflection: |
  Overall, this week went by pretty fast. I was able to accomplish alot this week from denoicing the images to completing the methodology.My team and I each got to a good standpoint in our project. I am starting to understand Python more and become intermediate using Overleaf. Next week my team and I, we will put a pause in our research and discuss how we will go about presenting the research we each have worked on so far for the mid-semester symposium.
