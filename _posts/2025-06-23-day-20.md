what_i_learned: |
  Today, we met with Professor Oladunni. He went over where we are so far in the research. The professor elaborated on what’s expected from us and gave us additional time to run our machine. Next, we briefly discussed the rubric for our mid-semester presentation. My team decided to divide it into sections, and tomorrow we will go into detail on the outline of the presentation.

reflection: |
  Overall, today was rough. I injured my foot, and the weather was too hot. I do feel that my team and I have made progress with the time we have to complete assignments. Tomorrow, we will have our first 1:1 session with our high school teacher. I’m not sure what to expect, but I look forward to it.
