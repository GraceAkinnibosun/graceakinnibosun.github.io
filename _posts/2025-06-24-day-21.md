what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on the mid-semester presentation that will be happening on friday. Dr Mack went over the expectations she has for us, and whats to be expected from us on friday. Next, we had a 1 hour meeting with our high school teacher Heather. We pretty much got to know more about her and she got to know more about us. Heather introduced us to a website I am not familliar with called Notebooklm which is a tool used to quote, and organize,  research. We caught her up to date on the work we have done so far.

  The Heat.

reflection: |
  Overall this heat, has me slighly on edge. It was confusing to me the changing of rooms/buildings. I think moving forward directions should be clear and consise, so that everyone in the group is on track. Often of times a public service annoucment is not annouced to the class but only to certain indivduals, this leads to confusion and can become very frustraing and leave people feeling lost. I definitley think implemting that will better our group as a whole.
