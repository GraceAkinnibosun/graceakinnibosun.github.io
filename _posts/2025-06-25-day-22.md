what_i_learned: |
  Today we discsused when we will start working on our presentation. Heather and I we both tag teamed the methodology section. I finshed the literature graph review, debreifed it with Heather. I also compared other researchers articles to see how the research they have completed differs from ours, and which ways I can use what they have wrote to improve our research.

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  Today wasnt bad. We got through alot, we hit a milestone in our project. We developed a unimodal base line model. Which is something I did not know how to do, but now I know how to do that I feel way more confidnet in my technical abilities. We also went grocey shopping in the Mckleinden building and the groceries werent expired and free big ups to the Morgan team for that.
