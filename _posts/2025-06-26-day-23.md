what_i_learned: |
  Today we practiced solving the unimodal code. We also worked on data preprocessing to see how we can denoice the image. Some of our algorthims were wrong so we had to go back and fix it.We got as far as completing the 2D CNN model. For the second half of the class we discussed which order we as agroup will present, and assign slides to each group memeber.

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  Today was a light day. No trouble everything was straight foward, I feel like now we are all starting to understand the importance of the research we are doing. I especially enjoyed being able to assit my team memebers as best as I can with the coding aspect of things. Our high school teacher Heather helped me out alot, I am so greatful she is here with us this cohort.
Tommorrow we will work on thhe group presentation and start the Powerpoint.
