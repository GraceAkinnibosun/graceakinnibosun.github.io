what_i_learned: |
 Today we practiced solving the unimodal code. We also worked on data preprocessing to see how we can denoise the image. Some of our algorithms were wrong so we had to go back and fix it. We got as far as completing the 2D CNN model. For the second half of the class we discussed which order we as a group will present, and assign slides to each group member.

reflection: |
  Today was a light day. No trouble everything was straight forward, I feel like now we are all starting to understand the importance of the research we are doing. I especially enjoyed being able to assist my team members as best as I can with the coding aspect of things. Our high school teacher Heather helped me out a lot, I am so grateful she is here with us this cohort.Tomorrow we will work on the group presentation and start the PowerPoint.
