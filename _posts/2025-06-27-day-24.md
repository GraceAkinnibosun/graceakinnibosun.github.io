what_i_learned: |
  Today Heather and I started the format for the final project. We incorporated the previous model that we used according to the professor request. We also, analyzed the graph of literature and included everyone in the group in our presentation. Next, we worked on the end of the week presentation, and discussed the further plans for next week symposium. We also started incorporating our work and formatting it into overleaf.

  Today was not bad it went by very fast. I am forever greatful for Ms Heather and her contribution. She was able to help me structure the final research project. I am almost done the Methodology section, and now I am preparring the Overleaf for the final presentation.
