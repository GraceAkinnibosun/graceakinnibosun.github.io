Today we mainly focused on getting everything organized for tommorrows submission. We focused hevaily on the mid-semester symposium. Along with our highschool teacher and graduate mentor help we were able to accomplish a good amount. With hopes of having everything completed by tonight, so we can start practcing for the mock presentation tommorrow.

  Heavy Rain.

reflection: |
  Overall today was challeging,and required alot of team effort. The rain was hectic I ended up getting completely drenched so that was excting. I like how everyone in my group chimed in so that we can get the presentation done. Its nice knowing you have a team you rely on to get you on track.I am feeling alot more confident now about tomorrow mock presentation.
