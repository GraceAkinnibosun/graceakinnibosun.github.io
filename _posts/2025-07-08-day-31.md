what_i_learned: |
  Today the professor came by and went over a few things with the group. He told us by next week we should be done the task he gaved to the group. Professor Oladunni gave us an overview of what we should expect coming up in the next few weeks. I and Heather started constructing the Googlecolab to Overleaf. We started to gather up everyones progress and incoporate it into Overleaf for our final presentation.

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  Overall today was very slow but productive. The professor provided us with good feedback, regarding our assignments. I will continue to add on to the Overleaf model this week, so it can be finalized in time for next week breifing with Professor Oladunni.I will update my blog on my progress each day this week
