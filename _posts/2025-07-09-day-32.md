what_i_learned: |
  Today we modified the Methodology section. We explained the meaning of some of our data in relation to ECG. I also made a group accesible GoogleDoc that I shared with each memeber of my group. Which consisted of the 20 articles formated in NOTEBOOK. I started to implement findngs from our mid-semester symposium into Overleaf to form a rough draft. 

blockers: |
  Organzing the methodology.

reflection: |
  Today went by smooth. I was able to make my rough draft make sense, and I got to write an overview of the literature review. Tommorow we will have a professional writer come and review what we have so far. So I really want to make sure I have something for her to look over.
