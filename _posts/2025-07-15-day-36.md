what_i_learned: |
  We spent a lot of time today completing the literature review for our final assignment.  The methodology for me was the homework that Professor Timothy gave us to finish last week. He came over and went over them with us.  We all had different tasks to complete, and he provided helpful criticism on each of my teamwork assignments.  The task we will be doing this week was then delegated by him.  Finally, I responded to the presentations given by other groups in week two.

  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  All in all, today was educational.  At the Earl G. Graves building, we finished a Briggs test and produced a gallery video.  We had an opportunity to get to know our group members better, and the gallery was pleasant.  Dr. Pandey and I will be meeting tomorrow to talk about formatting the study site.
