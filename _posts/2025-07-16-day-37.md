  Today we talked with the graduate professor. He decicided since we are cutting close to the end of the program, we should focus on the completion of our research project.He switched me from Methodology to the Literature reiview. He wants the boys in my group to work on coding and graphing, while the girls focus on the introduction and Lit review.

  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  Overall today was informative. We completed a Briggs test at the Earl G Graves building and did a gallery video. The gallery was nice we got a chance to know our group memebers better. Tommorow we will be meeting Dr Pandey to discuss the formatting of the research location.
