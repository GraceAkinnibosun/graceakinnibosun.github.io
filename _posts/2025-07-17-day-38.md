what_i_learned: |
  Today I needed patience. We had a presentation with DR Pandey, and she went over the Literature Review. Dr Pandey also discussed what is expected from us, and we went over steps for the Methodology. After we discussed the elevator pitch breifly, tommorrow we will go into detail on what exactly the requirements for the elevator pitch is.

  Arguing Team Members.

reflection: |
  Overall as I stated in what I learned, today required me to have alot of patience. My team members were arguing alot because of the lack of communication between the writers and the people doing the technical work. Hopefully tommorrow will be better. The good thing is that I am more or less almost done the Literature reviw. All thats left is going over the Overleaf and references in full in tommorows workshop.
