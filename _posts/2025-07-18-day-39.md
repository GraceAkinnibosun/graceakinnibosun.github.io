reflection: |
  Overall today was not bad. But it was productive, we accomplished alot. Nevertheless, we explored different topics we can discuss for our elevator pitch. Were counting down to the last few weeks. I am excited to see whats to come, but I am also nervous anticpiating the final two weeks.
