what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on finding a topic for our resume. We also worked on constructing Overleaf, my group memebers and I constructed the topic, and formatting of Overleaf.In additon to this I also worked on the Literature Review, three parts. And I read research articles to identify the research gap.Ms JJHeahter our high school teacher identified some grammtical errors within my literature review so I worked on improving it.

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  Overall today was very tiring. I had a long journey to come here, as my apartment was having issues. I had to travel from Bowie. I think surely by today I will be done.Tommorrow we will focus heavily on the Elevator pitch, and finalizing the final presentation. I will be implementing the critique, I recieved from my high school teacher, and Graduate professor to improve my studies.
