what_i_learned: |
  Today we set a meeting with Dr Pandey to go over our research paper that we done thus far. I started going over the work that has been done and revised the comments are high school teacher Ms Heather left from us. I then started on the Powerpoint slides for the final symposium. Finally we went over our plans as far as presentation goes.

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  I cannot complain, today went by smoothly. I finally can see the end of our research paper, and I am happy of the progress I made. I think my group and I got to a good standpoint in our research, and I foreshadow our final presentation during the final symposium to go well.I will give an update tommorrow on Dr Pandey findings.
