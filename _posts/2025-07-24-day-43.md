what_i_learned: |
  Today we spoke with the professor, and he pinpoint alot of things. He had some contributions, that we should add to the methodology section and introduction. He also, expressed his concerns for the publication. In addition to that, he added on a section for me to complete which relates to explaining the Unimodal. I am still working on completing the table. 

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  Today was a day. Its frustrating whenever we think we are almost done, the professor adds more work to our rooster. Dr Pandey canceled on us, so its like what now. I am trying my best to get a response by her at least monday. Now I am expecting her to be coming by tommorrow. Hopefully finger crossed she will come.
