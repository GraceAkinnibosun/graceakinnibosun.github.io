what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a meeting with Dr Calvin who is a PHD profesor at Alabama University. We worked in a team, along with his peer mentee to see the new robotic models they are in the process of completing. Additionally we also established a mechanism that will help my group memebers easily transfer the work we have done in Googledocs to Overleaf. Lastly we had a detailed meeting with Dr Pandey regarding our paper thus far. She shed light on alot of things within our paper we can improve and modify.

Wow I cant believe we are progressing to the last final week. This has been such an eye opening opportunity, I am greatful to be apart of. Next week my team and I will finalize the writing and reuslts of our project. We do plan on doing a mock  presentation someday next week to better prepare for the final symposium, which I look forward too.
