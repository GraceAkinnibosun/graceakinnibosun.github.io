what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused heaily as a group on completing Overleaf. We worked heavily as a group to implement the chages Dr Pandey gave us after reading our rough draft that we have so far. In addition to this we broke the research paper down into sections and proofread one another work. So far we aim on completing the whole paper by today before transferring it to Overleaf tommorrow.

blockers: |
  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  Moreover today was a light and easy day. I did start the day off feeling terribly sick, so that sucked. But, once I arrived for the internship this morning I felt motivated for the work I know I will achieve. This week is a very hetic week for all of us in this cohort, so my nerves has definitely arrisen. I will try and begin to practice my part for an 1 hour this week leading up to the final presentation.
