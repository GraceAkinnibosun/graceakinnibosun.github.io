what_i_learned: |
  Today was a fast and easy day. My group and I prioritized completing the final paper. Now, we are incorporating all of our findings into Overleaf. Now we are creating our demo video. We have started working on our Powerpoint,it will surely be done tommorow.

  No issues faced.

reflection: |
  No complaints for today, I really loved the team effort that my group and I put fourth. I cant belive there is only two days left of this program it is a bitter sweet moment. I am nervous for what I will say during the final symposium, since a lot is at stake.But Nevertheless, I will start working on practicing my slides.
