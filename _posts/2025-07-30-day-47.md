  Today was a workload heavy day. My group knocked out alot of work. Unfortunatley we did not hear back from Dr Pandey on are work but we did hear from the proffessor. The professor had alot of improvements to add so my team and I reakky had to use time maagement skills to be able to get everything done as our presentation for the final symposium is due today. But Nevertheless we were able to finish up. We did finish the overleaf but the professor wants us to revise some things.
