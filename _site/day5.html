    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>  Today we dived into the introduction of detecting abnormal abnormalities, to predict miocardial infraction. I achived alot in todays class. We first did an icebreaker to get to know our mentors and classmates for the program.It was nice to finally get to  know my more about my classmates and the face of who they are. Next, we leanred the background of CEALMS SAIRI. Lastly we explored how machine learning can play a vital role on ECG, and why it could be resourceful and threatning to the future of healthcare.I especially enjoyed the group discussion we completed in the beginning of the day  were we asked to decipher independent and dependent variables cooking cookies.</p>

<p>This helped me better understand how attention levels fluctuate, especially when switching between tasks. I also learned how to calculate moving averages to reduce noise in the signal while preserving response time.</p>

    <h3>Blockers</h3>
    <p>The biggest challenge I faced today, was reading the Electrocardiography graphs, and understanding some of the terminology that were using in class today.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I really enjoyed familiarizing myself with my project. It was nice to see the face of who my mentor and graduate. Some concepts such as AI terminology was a bit hard to understand, but overall today was a good effecient day. The only thing I would change or add is the more clearer instructions I also, would like them to elbaborate as mentors on whats expected from us by the end of the week.I will say I was lost a good portion of the time so making sure everyone understands the directions clearly should also be implemmented.</p>
