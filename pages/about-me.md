    I’m currently a senior studying Neuropsychology and Clinical Mental Healthcare at University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2025.

    I am happy to learn more about AI systems and machine learning. I look forward to applying my prior lab and work experience to enhance technology in healthcare.
